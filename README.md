# ElixirLS: Elixir support and debugger for VS Code

## ElixirLS is now being maintained by the community and this fork is no longer needed.

The [elixir-lsp](https://github.com/elixir-lsp)/[vscode-elixir-ls](https://github.com/elixir-lsp/vscode-elixir-ls) repo began as a fork when the original repo at [JakeBecker](https://github.com/JakeBecker)/[vscode-elixir-ls](https://github.com/JakeBecker/vscode-elixir-ls) became inactive for an extended period of time. So we decided to start an active fork to merge dormant PR's and fix issues where possible. We also believe in an open and shared governance model to share the work instead of relying on one person to shoulder the whole burden.

The original repo has been deprecated in favor of this one. Development will continue at the new repo, but updates will be published to the [original extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JakeBecker.elixir-ls), so please switch back to that one. Thanks!
