# ElixirLS: Elixir support and debugger for VS Code

Provides Elixir language support and debugger. This extension is powered by the [Elixir Language Server (ElixirLS)](https://github.com/JakeBecker/elixir-ls), an Elixir implementation of Microsoft's IDE-agnostic [Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol) and [VS Code debug protocol](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/api-debugging). Visit its page for more information. For a guide to debugger usage in Elixir, read [this blog post](https://medium.com/@JakeBeckerCode/debugging-elixir-in-vs-code-400e21814614).

# This project has moved!

It's now being maintained by proactive volunteers from the Elixir community over at [elixir-lsp](https://github.com/elixir-lsp)/[vscode-elixir-ls](https://github.com/elixir-lsp/vscode-elixir-ls). Updates will continue to be published from that repo to the original VS Code extension, so no need to switch plugins.

Thanks for using ElixirLS!
